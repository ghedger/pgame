pgame
=====

A Symfony project created on July 8, 2017, 12:28 pm.

This is a test project demonstrating a web implementation of rock/paper/scissors/spock/lizard for Advisors Excel.

Requirements
============

PGame is a probability game based on an extension to the childhood "Rock, Paper Scissors" popularized by the television series "The Big Bang Theory".  Each of two players presents a sign of one of the five signs: rock, paper, scissors, Spock, lizard.  Each sign beats two others and is defeated by the remaining two.  A tie results the event of the same selection by both parties.

In this web-based implementation, the key concerns rest in the underlying code and frameworks. Symfony 2.6 or later is to be used as a framework.  The Doctrine ORM will be used for mapping the model.  All underlying code must follow the PSR-2 coding standard (http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

The web page must present the following:
    - A way for the player to input his choice.
    - Reporting against a game history log and derived statistics is a must.

Authentication is NOT required for this implementation.
